TITANIC DATASET â€” EDA SUMMARY REPORT

1. Introduction
The Titanic dataset provides data about passengers, such as their age, gender, class, fare paid, and survival status.
The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights related to survival on the Titanic.

2. Dataset Overview
- Rows: 891 passengers
- Columns: 12 features (like Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex, etc.)
- Missing Values:
  - Age: Missing for 177 passengers
  - Cabin: Mostly missing
  - Embarked: 2 missing values

3. Univariate Analysis (Single Column)
- Sex: More males (577) than females (314).
- Pclass: Most passengers belonged to 3rd class.
- Age: Most passengers were between 20 to 40 years old.
- Fare: Majority paid low fares, few paid very high fares.

4. Bivariate Analysis (Comparing Two Columns)
- Survival by Sex: Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Survival by Class: 1st class passengers had higher survival rates than 2nd and 3rd class.
- Fare by Class: 1st class passengers paid higher fares on average.

5. Multivariate Analysis
- Heatmap:
  - Positive correlation between Fare and Survival (higher fare -> better chance of survival).
  - Negative correlation between Pclass and Fare (lower class -> cheaper fare).
- Pairplot:
  - Survivors often belonged to 1st class and paid higher fares.
  - Age and survival had no strong visible pattern.

6. Visual Insights Summary
- Histograms: Most passengers were young adults with low ticket fares.
- Barplots: Females and 1st class passengers had higher survival.
- Boxplots: Fare had many outliers, especially in 1st class.
- Heatmaps: Fare and Pclass strongly related to survival chances.

7. Conclusion
- Gender and Class were the strongest factors in survival.
- Younger passengers and higher-paying passengers had better survival chances.
- Cabin feature could be very informative, but it has too many missing values.
- Further modeling could predict survival using features like Sex, Pclass, and Fare.

8. Key Learnings
- EDA is essential for finding hidden patterns before modeling.
- Visualizations (barplots, heatmaps) make relationships easy to spot.
- Always check for missing data early in the process.
